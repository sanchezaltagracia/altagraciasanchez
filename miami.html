            Traveling gives me much joy by plane or by land,<br/>
            traveling  by plane gives me a lot of different sensations, of excitement and fear.<br/>
            Especially if there is a lot of turbulence. Because it gives me a lot of fear, and nerves.<br/>
            Once the plane hits the ground I feel safe, and it fills me with joy. 
            Traveling on land can better enjoy nature and its landscapes.<br/>
            You can stop when you want, drink coffee, eat, and rest.

         <p> On my visit to beautiful city of Miami Florida,<br/>
         I had the opportunity to visit Miami Beach and one of the most famous boulevards, called Ocean Drive.<br/>
         I was able to enjoy the beautiful colors and lights that decorate this lovely city.<br/>
         The best way to enjoy Ocean Drive Boulevard is to walk down the street<br/>
         which is characterized by its distinctive decorations of business art and its neon lights.<br/>
        Which are loud and flashy.

            <h2>Shops, Restaurants, and  The  Beach</h2>
            <a href="http://www.mangos.com/miami/">This is a link to Mango's</a>
        <p>
        
        There are many shops, clubs, restaurants along the way.<br/>
        They are open day and night. The waiters are very polite and friendly,<br/>
        they always have a smile on their face and they serve you with love.
        Mango's is a tropical cafe in south beach. It  is an open bar serving quesadillas, fried chicken wings, fries, salads, alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks. and much more.<br/>
        At night it becomes a place full of activities, artists who sing and dance live.<br/>
        They get you on the stage to dance and sing with them.The truth is that you can enjoy your vacations to the fullest.<br/>
        The truth is that I enjoy my vacations.
       </p>
       
       <p>
         
        On the beach you can relax, tan, talk with other people,<br/>
        enjoy water activities, such as swimming, surfing, jet skiing, snorkeling, and much more.<br/>
        On the beach it is allowed to take topless sunbathing.<br/>
        The sand slides by your fingers and feels very nice, there are also people who offer you massage at a considerable price.<br/>
        I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here in Miami.
